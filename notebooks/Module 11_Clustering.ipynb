K-Means and the Elbow Method**\n","K-means clustering is one of the simplest and popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms. The objective is to group similar data points together and discover underlying patterns. To achieve this objective, K-means looks for a fixed number (k) of clusters in a dataset. \n","\n","Clusters are groups of data with similar characateristics. They are built around centroids.

The ‘means’ in the K-means refers to averaging of the data; that is, finding the centroid. Here are the steps k Means takes:\n","1. You define k\n","2. The algorithm randomly places k points into the dataspace.\n","3. It then calculates the best position of these centroids based on which actual datapoints are the closest. This calculation is similar to the bckpropagation in a Neural Network, where the goal is to minimize the error in class assignment. The difference is that here, data points are assigned to clusters (not classes) and the calculation is not an activation function, but a Sum-of-Squares calculation. The position of the centroids adjusts until the algorithm stops.\n","4.
