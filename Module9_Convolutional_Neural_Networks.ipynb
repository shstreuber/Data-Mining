        " * **Example:** In an image classification task, early convolutional layers might learn to detect simple features like edges or corners, while deeper layers might combine these features into more complex patterns like textures or parts of objects.\n",
        "**2. Pooling (Subsampling) Layers**\n",
        " * **Function:** Pooling layers reduce the spatial dimensions (width and height) of the input, while retaining important information. They help make the learned features more robust to variations in input size or position.\n",

For RGB color images, each color channel (Red, Green, Blue) also ranges from 0 to 255.
